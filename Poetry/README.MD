## Poetry
- Poetry is a python dependency management tool to manage dependencies, packages, and libraries in your python project. 
- It makes the project more simple by resolving dependency complexities 
- To solve messy situations, Poetry comes here for us with only one pyproject.toml file to manage all the dependencies. 
- In other words, poetry uses pyproject.toml to replace setup.py, requirements.txt, setup.cfg, MANIFEST.in, and Pipfile.
- Poetry will help us to structurize our project
- Commands to manage, setup, run and deploy a project

Advantages of Poetry

- Keeping the dependency version compatible with the project.
