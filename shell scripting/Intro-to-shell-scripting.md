### Why do we need shell scripts

There are many reasons to write shell scripts â€“

- To avoid repetitive work and automation
- System admins use shell scripting for routine backups
- System monitoring
- Adding new functionality to the shell etc.

### Advantages of shell scripts

- The command and syntax are exactly the same as those directly entered in command line, so programmer do not need to switch to entirely different syntax
- Writing shell scripts are much quicker
- Quick start
- Interactive debugging etc.

### Below are some basic General purpose shell terminal commands

## whoami: 
Display the name of the current user

## id
This command displays the user id and group id information of the current user.

## date
The date command displays current date and time.
## date "+%D"
displays current date in mm/dd/yy format.
Below are some of the popular format specifiers that you can try out.

  %d	Display the day of the month (01 to 31)
  %h	Displays abbreviated month name (Jan to Dec)
  %m	Displays the month of year (01 to 12)
  %Y	Display four-digit year
  %T	Display the time in 24 hour format as HH:MM:SS
  %H	Display the hour

## ls
- List the files and directories in the current directory.<br>
  <b>ls /bin</b> : list all the files in the /bin directory.<br>
  <b>ls /bin/b* </b> : List all files starting with b in the /bin directory.<br>
  <b>ls /bin/*r </b> : List all files ending with r in the /bin directory.<br>
- <b> ls -l</b> Prints a long list of files that has additional information compared to the simple ls command.
Here are some popular options that you can try with the ls command.
  -a	list all the files including hidden files
  -d	list directories themselves, not their contents
  -h	with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K, 234M, 2G etc
  -l	long listing of files which include information about permission, owner, size etc
  -F	classify files by appending type indcator like *,/ etc. to file names
  -r	reverse order while sorting
  -S	sort by file size, largest first
  -t	sort by time, newest first
- Example 
- <b>ls -la /etc</b> to get a long listing of all files in /etc, including hidden files, if any
- <b>ls -lt /etc</b> to list the files based on modifcation time, use -t option. The most recently modified file will be on top.This is more frequently used with -l option.
- <b>ls -ld /etc</b> to view the current directory attributes instead of their contents, use the following command. If you want any other directory's attributes, provide the directory name as argument.
- <b>ls -lS /etc</b> to list the files sorted by file size in descending order /etc, use -S option.
- <b>ls -lrS /etc</b> to get the files sorted by file size in ascending order in /etc , add -r option.

- For example, to see the permissions for a file named 'usdoi.txt' in your current directory, run: <b>ls -l usdoi.txt </b>

A sample output looks like:

-rw-r--r-- 1 theia theia 8121 May 31 16:45 usdoi.txt

The permissions set here are 'rw-r--r--'

Here, owner has read and write permissions, group owner has read permission and others also have read permission.

## chmod

- <b>chmod</b> command lets you change the permissions set for a file.
- The change of permissions is specified with the help of a combination of the following characters:

### Perform search operations within the text
## grep
- grep command allows you to specify patterns and search for lines matching the pattern, from the input text.
- <b>grep people usdoi.txt</b> prints all lines in the file usdoi.txt which contain the word people.

Some of the frequently used options of grep are:
    -n	Along with the matching lines, print the line numbers also
    -c	Get the count of matching lines
    -i	Ignore the case of the text while matching
    -v	Print all lines which do not contain the pattern

## sed
- Syntax: <b>sed OPTIONS... [SCRIPT] [INPUTFILE...] </b>
- SED command in UNIX is stands for stream editor and it can perform lotâ€™s of function on file like, searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion.
- Though most common use of SED command in UNIX is for substitution or for find and replace. 
- By using SED you can edit files even without opening it, which is much quicker way to find and replace something in file, than first opening that file in VI Editor and then changing it.
- SED command in unix supports regular expression which allows it perform complex pattern matching.
Example:(display the content of geekfile.txt file) <br>
<b>$cat > geekfile.txt</b><br><br>

<b>unix is great os. unix is opensource. unix is free os.
learn operating system.

learn operating system.
linux linux which one you choose.
linux is easy to learn.unix is a multiuser os.Learn unix .unix is a powerful.

- <b>$sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt</b> Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line
output:
unix is great os. linux is opensource. unix is free os.
learn operating system.
unix linux which one you choose.
