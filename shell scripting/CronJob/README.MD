# All about CronJob
Remember that a crontab schedule has 5 stars relation to the time periods minute, hour, day-of-month, month-of-year, day-of-week. For this task, assume Sunday is the 0th day rather than the 7th day (as in some unix systems).

Note that where all time periods are not specified in the instructions below, you can assume those time periods are 'every' (*).
