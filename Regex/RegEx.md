## Introduction to Regular expressions

<b>Regular expressions</b> are extremely useful in extracting information from text such as code, log files, spreadsheets, or even documents. 
- The first thing to recognize when using regular expressions is that everything is essentially a character, and we are writing patterns to match a specific sequence of characters (also known as a string).
- Most patterns use normal ASCII, which includes letters, digits, punctuation and other symbols on your keyboard like %#$@!.
- Unicode characters can also be used to match any type of international text.
