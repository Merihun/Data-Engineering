## Building, Deploying, and Monitoring Your First Apache NiFi Dataflow

### The basics of Apache NiFi and its features.

- Apache NiFi is an open source data ingestion platform. 
- A real-time integrated data logistics and simple event processing platform
- It was developed by NSA and is now being maintained and further development is supported by Apache foundation. 
- Apache NiFi is a powerful, easy to use and reliable system to process and distribute data between disparate systems.
- It is based on Java, and runs in Jetty server. 
- It is licensed under the Apache license version 2.0. 
- Apache NiFi is a real time data ingestion platform, which can transfer and manage data transfer between different sources and destination systems. 
- It supports a wide variety of data formats like logs, geo location data, social feeds, etc. 
- It also supports many protocols like SFTP, HDFS, and KAFKA, etc. 
- Apache NiFi is an integrated data logistics platform for automating the movement of data between disparate systems. 
- It provides real-time control that makes it easy to manage the movement of data between any source and any destination. 
- It is data source agnostic, supporting disparate and distributed sources of differing formats, schemas, protocols, speeds and sizes such as machines, geo location devices, click streams, files, social feeds, log files and videos and more. 
- It is configurable plumbing for moving data around, similar to how Fedex, UPS or other courier delivery services move parcels around. 
- And just like those services, Apache NiFi allows you to trace your data in real time, just like you could trace a delivery.
- Apache NiFi is also able to dynamically adjust to fluctuating network connectivity that could impact communications and thus the delivery of data.

### Terminologies
<b>Dataflow</b>  the automated and managed flow of information between systems.

### Prerequisites
- You should have a basic understanding of Java, ETL, Data ingestion and transformation. 
- Familiarity with web server, platform configuration, and regex patterns.

### Apache NiFi- General Features

- Apache NiFi provides a web-based user interface, which provides seamless experience between design, control, feedback, and monitoring.
- It is highly configurable. This helps users with guaranteed delivery, low latency, high throughput, dynamic prioritization, back pressure and modify flows on runtime.
- It also provides data provenance module to track and monitor data from the start to the end of the flow.
- Developers can create their own custom processors and reporting tasks according to their needs.
- NiFi also provides support to secure protocols like SSL, HTTPS, SSH and other encryptions.
- It also supports user and role management and also can be configured with LDAP for authorization.
